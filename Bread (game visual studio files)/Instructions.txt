How to play:
1 player is guessing 1 player is setting a number to guess
"your turn" indicates that it is your turn to guess
"enemy turn" indicates that it is the enemy's turn to guess

after a number is pressed, a red indicator will be placed for you
after the enemy places their number, a greenindicator will be placed for you to see

After each round a message indicating the result of the round appears. DO NOT MAKE ANOTHER INPUT UNTIL THE MESSAGE DISSAPEARS

after 3 points are achieved for any number, it will be replaced with the sprite of a bread
the point of the game is to achieve 9 breads

to get points you correctly guess the enemy's secret number, this gives you 1 point under that bread
OR if you are setting the secret number, if the enemy gets is wrong, you gt a point under your secret number bread

when a guess and a secret number are the same, the turns flip
