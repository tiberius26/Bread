| Handmade Lite is an educational Visual Studio framework, written by Karsten Vermeulen,        |
| designed to assist with educating other fellow programmers, programming students, and anyone  |
| else wishing to learn about game development, C++, and object-oriented programming. This      |
| project is not open source and therefore has no license affiliated with it. Please be         |
| respectful and do not distribute the engine or its code as your work. You may alter or tweak  |
| the engine code as a learning experience and you may also 'borrow' code and functionality     |
| and use it to create your own game engine. Finally, please do use Handmade Lite to develop    |
| a game.                                                                                       |
